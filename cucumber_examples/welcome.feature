Feature: Cucumber
  In order to share the love
  As a presenter
  I want to demonstrate behaviour driven development with cucumber

  Scenario: Behaviour Driven Development with cucumber
    Given a desire for higher quality software
    And a tool that executes feature documentation written in plain text
    When you watch this presentation
    Then you will gain an understanding of behaviour driven development
    And see examples of behaviour driven development with cucumber
    And be equipped to integrate Cucumber into your development process
